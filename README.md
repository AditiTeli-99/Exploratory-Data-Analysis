# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## A. G20 Data Analysis

In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the World Bank Economic and social data to build insights on the G20 countries. I have used world bank's 
wbdata web api protocols to collect the data from World Bank website then I performed some data transformation and cleaning with the help of pandas library.
